deadlock detection in the distributed environment 

Deadlock detection is the process of actually determining that a deadlock exists and identifying the processes and resources involved in the deadlock. The basic idea is to check allocation against resource availability for all possible allocation sequences to determine if the system is in deadlocked state a, in this project, deadlock can be detected with the help of the both edge chasing and path pushing algorithms. It is mainly to reduce the drawbacks of the edgechasing algorithm. Basically, here we are trying to combine edge chasing with the path pushing algorithm to build a new methodology for detecting deadlock in this distributed environment.
