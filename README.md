# deadlock-detection
deadlock detection in the distributed environment 

here in this project, deadlock can be detected with the help of the both edge chasing and path pushing algorithms. It is mainly to reduce the drawbacks of the edgechasing algorithm. Basically, here we are trying to combine edge chasing with the path pushing algorithm to build a new methodology for detecting deadlock in this distributed environment.
